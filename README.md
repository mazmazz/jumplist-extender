**This software was last released in 2011 and is unsupported.** A [2015 update](https://github.com/mazmazz/jumplist-extender/releases)
added support for Windows 10 Version 1511.

## Features

### Add your own Program Tasks

You can add basic actions to your Jump List: inject a keyboard shortcut, or run a program with
command line switches.

### Pin Any Type of File

You can add any file or folder to your Jump List, whereas Windows normally restricts you to pinning
files that are associated with the program.

### Create Extensions to your Programs

Use AutoHotKey scripting syntax to run macros on your programs. E.g., you can add a "Save to Desktop
Notes" function to Notepad, or add "Snip and upload to Imgur" to Snipping Tool!

### Share your Jump Lists with Others

You can export your Jump Lists into "Jumplist Pack" (*.JLP) archives, which are redistributable.
