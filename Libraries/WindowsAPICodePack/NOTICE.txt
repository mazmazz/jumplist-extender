NOTICE

WINDOWS API CODE PACK is not distributed with Jumplist Extender's source because it uses a non-GPL compatible license. Because of this, Jumplist Extender WILL NOT BUILD unless you download this library's source, and apply the included changes.

Replacing Windows API Code Pack with a free alternative is on the roadmap for v2.0. If you feel empowered, you can help write a library! 


PROGRAM DETAILS

Jumplist Extender uses the Windows API Code Pack to:

1. Apply jumplists to a Win7 "appId"
2. Apply Win7 "appIds" to the affected programs' shortcuts and windows

In other words, Windows' jumplists are applied to the program by assigning the program and its shortcuts to a specific "appId." The appId then has a jumplist assigned to it, so the correct jumplits is shown for the program.

For more information, see "Win7 Taskbar links.pdf".


THEREFORE

The ideal free alternative must be able to:

1. Apply and delete a jumplist from an appId
1a. Implement jumplist "verbs", groups, and separators (basically an empty "verb")
2. Apply and delete an appId from a LNK shortcut file.
3. Apply and delete an appId from a program window

All of these can be accomplished via C++ calls and P/Invokes.
